## What it does

Metria shows current session and monthly usage percentages for supported AI providers.

- **Usage widget**: a right-edge widget for provider usage cards.
- **System tray**: compact access to provider usage and controls.
- **Dashboard window**: detailed per-provider cards and usage gauges.

The app stores its settings in its own `com.metria.electron` application-data namespace.

## Download

Download the installer for your operating system from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yurirxmos/metria-win-linux/releases) page.

- **Windows**: `.exe` installer.
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` package.

Electron releases are unsigned. Windows SmartScreen may display a warning during installation.

## To do

- Improve Metria compatibility and runtime support for Windows and Linux.
- Add usage-aware sounds and animations.

## Providers

Providers are enabled automatically when their local credentials or usage files are detected. Providers that are not installed remain available in Settings with setup guidance.

- **Claude**: credentials read from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` on Unix and from the equivalent host or WSL location on Windows.
- **Codex**: credentials and the newest session read from `CODEX_HOME`/`~/.codex`, including WSL locations on Windows.
- **OpenCode Go**: credentials read from `XDG_DATA_HOME`/`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` on Unix, `%APPDATA%` on Windows, or the WSL path.

Providers are discovered on the host filesystem and, on Windows, in installed WSL distributions. These read-only locations are fixture-tested, not runtime-tested on every supported platform.

Credentials are never committed. Metria reads them at runtime from the documented local sources.

## Mobile PWA

This version does not include phone pairing, the local PWA server, QR pairing, or mobile alerts. Those features belong to the native macOS application.

## Requirements

- Windows or Linux for the supported desktop application.
- Node.js 22+ and npm for building from source.
- Windows and Linux builds must be created and runtime-tested on their respective platforms.

## Quick start

Download the latest installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yurirxmos/metria-win-linux/releases), or build it on Windows or Linux:

```sh
npm ci
npm run package
```

The host-native installer is created in `release/`.

### Run in development

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Run the checks with:

```sh
npm run check
```

Push an `electron-v*` tag to package and publish a release:

```sh
git tag electron-v0.2.0
git push origin electron-v0.2.0
```

The updater uses the dedicated `electron-latest` channel in this repository.

## Project layout

- `src/main/`: provider files, network calls, settings, tray, windows, and IPC.
- `src/preload/`: the typed `window.metria` context bridge.
- `src/renderer/`: sandboxed React dashboard, widget, and usage card.
- `src/shared/`: shared TypeScript types and provider presentation helpers.
- `src/test/`: provider, path, and WSL fixture tests.
- `resources/`: Electron icons and bundled provider assets.
- `.github/workflows/electron-release.yml`: Windows/Linux release automation.

## Architecture and security

- Browser windows use `contextIsolation: true`, `sandbox: true`, and `nodeIntegration: false`.
- The renderer has no Node or Electron imports.
- The preload exposes only typed, allowlisted `window.metria` methods.
- Every IPC method validates its sender and arguments.
- The app uses local packaged content and does not share storage with the native macOS app.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Open an issue to report a bug or suggest a feature, or open a pull request with a focused change.

- Keep changes focused and follow the existing code style.
- Keep all repository text in en-US.
- Do not commit credentials, generated build output, or local configuration.
- Create and runtime-test Windows and Linux packages on their respective platforms.
